## About

I am a passionate researcher that loves to look at problems in a different perspective. 


Born in Brazil, my interest for technology was first materialized on my passion for games. I started my graduation on Computer Science in 2010 without knowing for sure in what I was getting into. For my big surprise, It was a perfect match. I started  my scientific career still in graduation while developing a digital library. The research process enchanted me and, as soon as I got my diploma, I started a master degree in Computer Science.


My master subject was about data mining and pattern discovery. I worked on a new research field called knowledge discovery on spatial-temporal data of moving objects. This data is mostly composed by trajectories of moving objects. My final work was developing an algorithm to discover the chasing behavior between two trajectories. During my master I also worked on a project to develop a web-based system to register accidents involving hazardous materials in federal highways.


After finishing my master I immediately started a PhD degree. This time I applied my knowledge on trajectories in the mobile robot field. I am currently working on a framework for intelligent navigation of mobile robots using several technologies like semantic trajectories, fuzzy systems and behavior tree.


As for my personal interest, I am an enthusiastic gamer. Me and my friend started a youtube channel as a personal project to have some fun. This was great to stimulate my creativity and also made me learn about video and audio edition. It is an escape of the real world and a fun way to connect with other people. I also like music, tv series, books, geeks and nerdy stuff, podcasts and political content. 


My motto is that nothing is 100% true or right, and I should always be ready to learn new things or change my mind about something I thought it was right. I learn from the past, but I live on the present.
